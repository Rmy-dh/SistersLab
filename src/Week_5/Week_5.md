## **1 - [Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)**

* Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

``` 
     Input:   nums = [3,0,1]  
     Output:  2       
```
``` 
     Input:   nums = [0,1]  
     Output:  2       
```
``` 
     Input:   nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]  
     Output:  8       
```
## **2-[Container With Most Water]( https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)**

* You are given an integer array height of length n.
* There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
* Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
* Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.


``` 
     Input:   height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] 
     Output:   49        
```
``` 
     Input:   height = [1,1] 
     Output:  1       
```
## **3-[Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/)**

* Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

``` 
     Input:   x = 123  
     Output:  321         
```
``` 
     Input:   x = -123 
     Output:  -321         
```
``` 
     Input:   x = 120
     Output:  21        
```
